### About Me!

Hey there! My name is Yashil Vora and I am a second-year Computer Science major from Seventh College. Living in San Diego over the past year and a half has been a great experience for me and I have come to really love this city and university.

#### My Hobbies

1.  Basketball
2.  Squash
3.  Piano
4.  Watching movies

Here are some of the things I want to do in San Diego (the ones ticked are places I've already been to)!

- [ ] Balboa Park

#### My CS Background

I started coding in highschool. Here are some of the technologies that I am familiar with:

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express.js, Vue.js,  Pytorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, VS Code, Junit

The very first line of code that I wrote was:

`print("Hello, World!")`

Another one of my first code samples is: 

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
 
I am also familiar with using Linux commands and Git commands. Here is a screenshots of this!
